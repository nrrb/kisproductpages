    "description_long": "This desktop packs a punch in a smaller package than before. With the 3.60 GHz Intel Core i7-7700 processor, 16 GB RAM (expandable to 64 GB), and a 512 GB SSD using the new NVMe interface (up to 4X as fast as existing SATA SSDs), you don't have to spend a lot to get workstation-level performance. There's room for expansion, with 2.5\" and 3.5\" drive bays for SATA drives, potentially allowing expansion by several Terabytes. The onboard video provides dual monitor output at 2K each, and it's easily upgradeable with a video card to provide triple monitor output at 4K each.",
