    "description_long": "This Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon is the fifth generation of the most popular ultraportable laptop at Kellogg. It's favored for its 14\" screen, solid build quality, exceptionally low weight and thickness, and performance that's competitive with larger laptops. This is a favorite among travelers, anyone who doesn't want to heft unnecessary weight, and those who want a simple docking experience (using just one cable with the Thunderbolt 3 dock).",
    "highlights": [
    	"Thinnest (0.63\") and lightest (2.49 lb) full-size ultraportable laptop available.",
        "Despite being ultraportable it has all the power of larger laptops, including the newest generation of the Intel i7 2.80 GHz processor, 16 GB RAM, and 512 GB SSD.",
        "With the Thunderbolt 3 dock, this can output to two 4K monitors. This makes the laptop suitable as a desktop replacement, depending on your usage.",
        "3 year Accidental Damage Protection warranty covers all accidental damage, including water damage and drops."
