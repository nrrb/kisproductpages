    "description_long": "The ThinkPad T470s maximizes performance while reducing cost at the slight expense of portability (as compared to the X1-series laptops). Still, at under 3/4\" thick and under 3 lb in weight, this is extremely portable. The model that KIS is recommending has a touch screen. With the ThinkPad Ultra Dock, this laptop supports two 4K monitors. If you need to eke out as much memory as possible, the RAM is upgradeable to 24 GB. For quick recovery in the case of hardware problems, KIS is focused on stocking loaner shells of this type.",
